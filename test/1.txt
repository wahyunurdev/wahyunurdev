US Customs and Border Protection, the Department of Homeland Security, and the Department of Commerce have been approached for comment.

DHL's reversal is the latest development in the ongoing tussle between businesses and the White House over US tariff policies.

Previously, packages worth up to $2,500 could enter the US with minimal paperwork but, due to tighter customs checks that came into force alongside the tariffs earlier this month, the threshold has been lowered.

DHL said last week the change had "caused a surge in formal customs clearances, which we are handling around the clock".

It said that while it was working to "scale up and manage this increase, shipments worth over $800, regardless of origin, may experience multi-day delays".

However, on Monday, DHL lifted the suspension after negotiations with customs authorities and other US government bodies.

"The express industry... had a constructive dialogue with [the US government] to optimise customs regulations as to ensure critical goods still reach US businesses and consumers in a timely, safe and compliant manner," a DHL spokesperson said.

"Adjustments to US customs regulations will allow DHL to resume accepting business to consumer shipments with a declared value exceeding $800 into the US."

'De minimis' rule
The back and forth between DHL and the White House comes as the US government looks to clamp down on deliveries under $800 - specifically those sent from China and Hong Kong.

On 2 May, it intends to close a loophole allowing low-value packages to enter the US without incurring any duties.

The removal of the so-called "de minimis" rule will affect the likes of the fast-fashion firm Shein and low-cost retail giant Temu.

Shein and Temu have both warned that they will increase prices "due to recent changes in global trade rules and tariffs".
