DHL's reversal is the latest development in the ongoing tussle between businesses and the White House over US tariff policies.

DHL said last week the change had "caused a surge in formal customs clearances, which we are handling around the clock".

The removal of the so-called "de minimis" rule will affect the likes of the fast-fashion firm Shein and low-cost retail giant Temu.

Shein and Temu have both warned that they will increase prices "due to recent changes in global trade rules and tariffs".

US Customs and Border Protection, the Department of Homeland Security, and the Department of Commerce have been approached for comment.


Previously, packages worth up to $2,500 could enter the US with minimal paperwork but, due to tighter customs checks that came into force alongside the tariffs earlier this month, the threshold has been lowered.
