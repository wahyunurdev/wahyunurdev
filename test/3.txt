To explain how the four stages of learning within the **Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD)** apply to scaffolding in programming education, let's consider a learner developing an e-commerce application. The ZPD focuses on the area between what a learner can do independently and what they can achieve with guidance from a more knowledgeable other (such as a teacher or peer). The following stages—**inter-mental**, **intra-mental**, **intersubjectivity**, and **automatization**—represent different phases of this process:

### 1. **Inter-mental (Social Level of Learning)**
At the **inter-mental** stage, the learning takes place **socially**, between the learner and a more capable adult or peer. The learner actively interacts with the mentor to co-construct knowledge and understanding.

**Example in Programming Education (E-commerce Development):**  
The learner, under the guidance of the mentor, is introduced to the concept of **handling payments in an e-commerce app**. The mentor demonstrates how to integrate a payment system like **Stripe** into the platform. Through a collaborative coding session, the mentor explains the API setup, key functions, and how to authenticate payment details securely. During this process, the learner asks questions, and the mentor provides real-time explanations, working through the task together.

At this stage, the learner's understanding is heavily influenced by the mentor's expertise, and the support is responsive to the learner’s immediate needs. The task is too difficult for the learner to complete independently but achievable with the mentor’s help.

### 2. **Intra-mental (Internalization of Learning)**
After the initial collaborative phase, the learner begins to internalize the knowledge, moving the learning from the **inter-mental** to the **intra-mental** level, where the learner begins to perform tasks independently.

**Example in Programming Education (E-commerce Development):**  
The learner now tries to implement a **payment gateway** independently, using the Stripe API integration process they practiced with the mentor. The learner might consult documentation or previous notes and tries to debug any issues on their own. While the learner may still occasionally seek help, they can perform the core tasks of integrating the payment API with minimal assistance, as the process has become part of their own cognitive toolkit. This stage involves internalizing the process, so the learner doesn’t need to rely on direct instruction every time.

At this stage, the learner has moved beyond external guidance and is able to reason through the task themselves, using their newly acquired mental models.

### 3. **Intersubjectivity (Shared Understanding)**
Intersubjectivity refers to the **shared understanding** that is developed between the learner and the mentor. It's the collaborative creation of a common goal or understanding during the learning process, where both parties are aligned in their comprehension of the task or concept.

**Example in Programming Education (E-commerce Development):**  
While working on a new feature—say, the **shopping cart functionality**—the mentor and learner engage in discussion about the **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** architecture for the e-commerce platform. They both agree that implementing this design pattern will help with organizing the code and separating concerns between different aspects of the application (e.g., database models, user interface, etc.). The mentor explains the benefits of MVC, and the learner asks clarifying questions, ensuring that both have a mutual understanding of how to structure the code for the cart. The shared goal is to ensure that the application is scalable and maintainable.

In this phase, the mentor and learner's mutual understanding helps them co-construct knowledge and establish a clear direction for the next steps in the development process.

### 4. **Automatization (Independent Application of Skills)**
At the **automatization** stage, the learner has internalized the skills and knowledge to the point where they can now perform tasks without needing conscious thought or guidance. The learner can execute tasks with ease and efficiency.

**Example in Programming Education (E-commerce Development):**  
Now, the learner has independently developed several features for the e-commerce platform, such as the **product catalog**, **user authentication**, and **shopping cart**. These tasks have become **automatic**, and the learner can integrate new features into the platform with minimal effort. For example, the learner might independently implement a **new user registration flow** using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for session management. The steps are no longer difficult, and the learner can quickly build new functionalities without extensive guidance, relying on their accumulated understanding of the platform's architecture and coding practices.

At this stage, the learner has become highly proficient, and the skills have become automatic—allowing them to focus on optimizing performance or adding more complex features independently.

### Summary of the Stages with Examples:
- **Inter-mental**: The learner works closely with the mentor to integrate a **payment system** (collaborative, guided learning).
- **Intra-mental**: The learner begins independently coding the payment system integration after the mentor's guidance, internalizing the process.
- **Intersubjectivity**: The learner and mentor discuss and agree on the **MVC architecture** for the e-commerce platform, ensuring a shared understanding of how to structure the app.
- **Automatization**: The learner autonomously builds and integrates features like **user authentication** and the **shopping cart**, applying skills with ease.

Through this progression, the learner moves from needing full support to becoming capable of independently developing complex e-commerce features, demonstrating the power of scaffolding in the **ZPD**.
