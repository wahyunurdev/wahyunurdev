### ðŸŽ® Play a Simple Game!

Let's play a **Number Guessing Game**. I'll pick a random number between 1 and 100, and you have to guess it!

#### Steps to play:
1. **Guess the number** by choosing a number between 1 and 100.
2. Iâ€™ll tell you if the number is too high, too low, or correct!
3. The goal is to guess the number in as few tries as possible.

#### Start the game:
```bash
# Start the Number Guessing Game

1. Guess a number between 1 and 100.
2. You'll get a hint whether the number is higher or lower.
3. Keep guessing until you find the correct number!

Example of how to play in your console:
- **Guess**: 50
- **Response**: "Too high!" or "Too low!" or "Correct!"
